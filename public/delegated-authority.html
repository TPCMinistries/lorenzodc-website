            <div class="key-point">
                <h3>The Amygdala Hijack</h3>
                <p>When you hear "submit to authority," your brain's alarm system (the amygdala) may trigger an automatic threat response. This is normal and predictable. <span class="highlight">Submission feels dangerous to our natural mind</span> because it bypasses our survival instinct for self-protection and control.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="intro-text" style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 28px;">
                <strong>What happens in your brain when challenged about authority:</strong>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Amygdala detects perceived threat:</strong> Loss of control, vulnerability, potential for harm</li>
                <li><strong>Fight/flight/freeze response activates:</strong> Body prepares to resist or escape</li>
                <li><strong>Prefrontal cortex goes offline:</strong> Rational thinking shuts down temporarily</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional reactions dominate:</strong> Resistance, defensiveness, anger, or withdrawal</li>
                <li><strong>Justification mechanisms engage:</strong> Mind finds reasons why this doesn't apply to you</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="quote-box" style="margin-top: 30px;">
                "This teaching isn't intuitive to our natural mind. Your brain will fight it because submission challenges the kingdom of self. That resistance you're feeling? It's actually proof you're hearing something that disrupts your flesh's demand for autonomy. The natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God."

            <h2>Expansion Requires Maintenance</h2>
            <div class="story-box">
                <p><strong>After ten days ministering in South Africa</strong>—teaching at leadership panels, establishing ministry partnerships, flowing in prophetic moments—I came home spiritually full but physically exhausted. The assignment had been powerful. Lives were changed. Connections were made.</p>
                <p>But the next assignment came immediately: teach this very message on delegated authority.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 22px;">This week, while driving to prepare, <strong>a road sign got trapped under my car and pierced my brake hose.</strong> The car could still move forward—the engine ran fine, everything seemed functional. But I couldn't stop safely. The pressure was leaking.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.6rem; font-style: italic; color: #fff; margin-top: 28px;">And the Spirit whispered: <span class="highlight">"This is exactly what happens when expansion outruns maintenance. When ministry growth exceeds relationship care."</span></p>

            <div class="intro-text" style="font-size: 1.6rem; margin-top: 30px;">
                We can minister globally yet ignore leaks locally:
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>Unresolved tension with those in authority over us</li>
                <li>Broken relationships we've been too busy to repair</li>
                <li>Offense we've justified rather than releasing</li>

            <h2>The Centurion's Secret</h2>
            <div class="scripture-box">
                <div class="verse">"A certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die. And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant... The centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof... For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh: and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it. When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel."</div>

                <h3>What the Centurion Understood:</h3>
                <p>This was a man of great faith AND a man who had authority AND who was <span class="highlight">under authority.</span> These three realities were not separate—they were one integrated system.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">He recognized that Jesus' authority over sickness didn't come from personal power alone, but from perfect alignment with the Father. He understood the Kingdom operates on principles of submission and delegated authority.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">His faith wasn't just faith in Jesus' ability (power). It was faith in Jesus' <span class="highlight">divine authorization</span> (authority). He knew that words spoken from proper position carry the backing of the one who gave the position.</p>

            <div class="key-point" style="margin-top: 30px;">
                <h3>The Principle of Inseparability:</h3>
                <p>Let us examine more deeply this principle that it is not a person who is sacred, but rather it is that office in which he stands. We saw this previously in the example of King Saul of Israel.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">Who put Saul in his place of authority? Did the people make him king? No, the Lord set him in place as the King of Israel. As wicked as he was, the people did not oust him from his office.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">Several times it is recorded that David could have taken his life, but he did not touch "the Lord's anointed." Even though Saul himself had committed evil, because he was the office as king, he could not be touched. <span class="highlight">The people waited for the Lord to remove him.</span> It was not the person (Saul) who commanded respect; it was the office, the position of authority, delegated by God.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="scripture-box" style="margin-top: 28px;">
                <div class="verse">"Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation."</div>
                <div class="reference">Romans 13:2 (KJV)</div>
            </div>
            <div class="quote-box">
                When we find ourselves resisting "the power," those placed in authority over us, we are faced with the fact that we are in reality resisting God Himself. How is this so? A human government can be used by God to execute His plans. As we noted previously, Romans 13:1 tells us "...there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God."

                <div class="verse">"The Lord forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the Lord's anointed, or lay my hand on him; for he is the anointed of the Lord."</div>
                <div class="reference">1 Samuel 24:6 (NIV)</div>
            </div>
            <div class="key-point">
                <h3>David's Example:</h3>
                <p>David was anointed as king while Saul still sat on the throne. God had clearly chosen David as the next king. Saul was persecuting David unjustly, trying to kill him out of jealousy and paranoia.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 18px;">Twice David had the perfect opportunity to take Saul's life—once in a cave, once while Saul slept. His men urged him: "This is the day the Lord spoke of!" But David refused.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 18px;"><span class="highlight">Why? Because it was not David's place to remove what God had put in place.</span> David honored Saul's office, not Saul's behavior. He waited for God's timing, even though waiting was costly and dangerous.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="quote-box" style="margin-top: 28px;">
                "Sometimes we limit God. We do not acknowledge that He is in control; that He is on the throne. Could it be that what we think needs to come down could still be God's choice in a situation? Perhaps He desires that person to remain. David sinned while he was king of Israel. Was he removed immediately? No; the Lord dealt with him while he was still in office. He was not excluded from reigning; God simply judged him while he was king, thus giving the people a pattern and example of repentance and restoration."

            <div class="intro-text" style="font-size: 1.6rem; margin-top: 28px;">
                <strong>If someone is selected and elected by God to fill a certain position, and if He has placed him there, can we not assume that God is big enough to remove him if He so desires?</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="key-point" style="margin-top: 25px;">
                <p>When we look into the Spirit, we see that there will be times when God must reject certain ones from before Him, much as was the case with Saul. Yet, even as Saul was respected because of his office, so will these be. <span class="highlight">And if we move in the flesh to take men out of their offices, we will see the hand of God's judgment.</span> The message will be, "Although I reject them, it does not mean I call you to reject them."</p>

                    <h4>Power vs Authority</h4>
                    <p>Authority is the right to act based on divine alignment. We are Kingdom ambassadors under spiritual protocol.</p>
                </div>

                    <h4>We Are Leaking</h4>
                    <p>Broken submission and unresolved offense cause us to lose spiritual pressure.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="small-column">

                    <h4>Submission ≠ Obedience</h4>
                    <p>Submission is absolute heart posture. Obedience is relative and limited by conscience.</p>
                </div>

        <div class="slide bg-gradient-2">
            <h2>This Week: Practical Action Steps</h2>
            <div class="section-divider"></div>
            <div class="intro-text" style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 30px;">
                Theology without application is information, not transformation. Here's what to do this week:
            </div>

            <div class="key-point">
                <h3>Step 1: Identify Your Leak</h3>
                <p>Before the week ends, identify one specific area where you're losing spiritual pressure. Name it. Write it down. Is it unforgiveness toward someone in authority? A critical spirit? Isolation from accountability? Unresolved conflict?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="key-point" style="margin-top: 25px;">
                <h3>Step 2: Repair One Relationship</h3>
                <p>Choose one relationship that needs maintenance. This could be with someone over you, beside you, or under you. Initiate reconciliation, apologize where needed, or simply check in. Don't let another week pass with the leak unaddressed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="key-point" style="margin-top: 25px;">
                <h3>Step 3: Honor One Person You Disagree With</h3>
                <p>Find someone in authority over you with whom you disagree. Deliberately honor them this week—not because you agree with their decisions, but because you honor the office God has given them. Speak well of them. Pray for them. Serve them.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="scripture-box" style="margin-top: 30px;">
                <div class="verse">"Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says."</div>
                <div class="reference">James 1:22 (NIV)</div>

                These three steps will test whether you're a <em>diakonos</em> or a <em>doulos</em>.

            <div class="prayer-text">
                <p>
                    <strong>Father God,</strong> restore integrity to our lines of authority.
                    Heal the leaks in our relationships, repair the breaches in our submission,
                    refill our spiritual reservoirs, and keep us aligned under Your perfect government.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 28px;">
                    Give us grace to honor even when we disagree, strength to serve when we're exhausted,
                    and wisdom to wait when every instinct screams to take matters into our own hands.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 28px;">
                    Lord, bore a hole through our ears in the House of God. Mark us as Your <em>doulos</em>—
                    not just workers for Your kingdom, but bondservants who love the Master.
                    Make us leaders who descend to the foundation to serve, not climb to the top to be served.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 28px;">
                    We declare: We are ambassadors of Your Kingdom, carrying delegated authority through submitted hearts.
                    Where we have resisted You by resisting authority, forgive us. Where we have leaked pressure through offense, seal us.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 28px;">
                    Send us out from this place flowing in divine order, maintaining pressure under testing,
                    and releasing miracles through proper alignment.
