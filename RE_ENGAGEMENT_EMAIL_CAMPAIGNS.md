## 🔥 Quick Win Ideas

### 1. LinkedIn Post Strategy
After sending email, post on LinkedIn:
```
Just sent 59 leaders their AI readiness assessment results.

The most surprising finding?

The CEOs who thought they were "AI-ready"
averaged 42%.

The ones who thought they were "behind"
averaged 68%.

Perception ≠ Reality when it comes to AI adoption.
